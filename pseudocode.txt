1a) Draw a square subroutine

Pen down
Repeat 4 times
	Move lengthofsides
	Turn 90

1b) Draw a 'grid of squares' subroutine

Pen up
Repeat gridHeight times (Loop invariant: the number of times the loop has been repeated never goes above gridHeight)
	Repeat gridWidth times (Loop invariant: the number of times the loop has been repeated never goes above gridWidth)
		drawSquare(theTurtle, lengthOfSide)
		Turn 90
		Move (lengthOfSide + distanceBetweenSquares)
		Turn 270
	Turn 270
	Move ((lengthOfSide + distanceBetweenSquares) * gridWidth)
	Turn 90
	Turn 180
	Move (lengthOfSide + distanceBetweenSquares)
	Turn 180
Move ((lengthOfSide + distanceBetweenSquares) * gridHeight)

1c) threeSquareGrid subroutine
drawSquareGrid made of 4 large squares
move 2
turn 90
move 2
turn 270
drawSquareGrid made of 16 medium squares
move 6
turn 90
move 6
turn 270
drawSquareGrid made of 64 small squares
turn 180
move 8
turn 90
move 8
